TowerWall
=========

Status wall web app.  

I made this to work on multiple platforms so i can be used as a status wall or on a simple monitor. It is simple intro for my self in Web Development using many of the things i 
have learned over the past few months. It uses some apis from others here on github, and a few apis from the likes of twitter
and google. The twitter protion is taken from this website http://www.queness.com/post/14004/easiest-way-to-retrieve-twitter-timeline-and-hashtags-twitter-oauth-api-11/page/5#comments
. I found it to be the simplest and most effective way to grab what i wanted from twitter.
